Credit Card Fraud Detection using Python &amp; DataScience

Credit card fraud poses a significant risk to both financial institutions and cardholders. This project focuses on developing a predictive model using Python and data science techniques to accurately detect fraudulent credit card transactions. By using machine learning algorithms, we aim to safeguard customers from financial losses and ensure transaction security.

Project Overview:

1.Data Collection:
-Collect a comprehensive dataset including transaction details and a binary label indicating fraud.

2.Data Preprocessing:
-Clean and prepare data, handling missing values, normalizing features, and addressing imbalanced data.

3.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
-Analyze data distributions and identify fraud patterns or outliers.

4.Feature Engineering:
-Create relevant features to improve model performance.

5.Model Selection:
-Choose suitable machine learning algorithms for fraud detection.

6.Model Training:
-Split data for training and testing, then fit models and evaluate performance.

7.Model Evaluation:
-Assess model accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC curve.

8.Hyperparameter Tuning:
-Optimize model parameters to prevent overfitting and enhance accuracy.

9.Model Deployment:
-Deploy the best-performing model for real-time fraud detection.

10.Results and Conclusion:
-Summarize project outcomes, evaluate model effectiveness, and suggest areas for improvement.
